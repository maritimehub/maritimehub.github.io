However, they are energy intensive and increase both fuel consumption and emission. Cruise operators are focusing on reducing carbon footprint per passenger. No matter which type of fuel that is used to supply the energy demand onboard, the focus should be to reduce the energy usage, i.e. limiting fuel consumption.\n\nSince the HVAC&R systems is the main power consumers, together with propulsion, the development of energy-efficient design and operation can make a significant difference in the total power demand. This enables down-sizing of generators, implying weight reductions, and thus, further reductions in propulsion-related fuel consumption., and the size of generators i.e., also weight savings.\n\nAnother sustainability aspect is the over-dimensioning of systems, as a result of designing the systems for operational conditions that might, but never / seldom occurs. Many systems are designed for conditions well above what is ever recorded. The negative consequences of too large plants are higher costs, excessive use of materials, reduced energy efficiency, takes up more space and adds weight to the ship.\n\nIn terms of environmental sustainability, a standardised method for assessing the climate impact of refrigeration system is essential. There are various ways to estimate the environmental impact of the HVAC&R units. The simplest way is to just relate it to refrigerant GWP, which only considers the direct impact on global warming, which occurs when the refrigerant is released from the system, through accidental or operational leakage.\n\nThe **Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI)** is an established method within the refrigeration sector to quantify the global warming impact of a HVAC&R system, including both direct (refrigerant leakage during operation and disposal) and indirect (power consumption) emissions. Typical values for the annual leakage rate are given for different equipment types and applications. For marine units, the leakage rate ranges between 20% and 40%. it should be emphasised that the TEWI comparison, to be of real value, must relate to systems of equal duty and function.
